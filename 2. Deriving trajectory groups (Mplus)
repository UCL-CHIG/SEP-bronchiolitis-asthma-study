MODEL:
! This describes the model to be estimated
! i s q cu are names for intercept, slope, quadratic and cubic terms, respectively

	%overall%
	i s q cu | aw2@0 aw3@1 aw4@2 aw5@3 aw6@4
			aw7@5 aw8@6 aw9@7;
i-cu @ 0;

! Delete “@ 0” to allow within class variation (GMM model)
! This allows for the additional terms needed for GMM models

OUPUT: TECH1 TECH8 TECH11 TECH 14 CINTERVAL;

! TECH1 produces starting values for all free parameters in the model
